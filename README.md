## About The Project

This project aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset.  
It is based on the [Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), a well-established benchmark in clinical machine learning tasks.

We implemented standardized preprocessing, SMOTE-based balancing, and multiple classification algorithms including KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.  
Nested cross-validation was used to ensure robust model selection and performance evaluation.




## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Dependencies

Below are the main Python libraries and tools required to run this project.  
We recommend installing them in a clean virtual environment using `conda`.

- **Python 3.10**

- **Pandas 2.2.1**

- **NumPy 1.26.4**

- **matplotlib 3.8.4**

- **Seaborn 0.13.2**

- **Scikit Learn 1.4.2**

- **Imbalanced-learn 0.12.2**






## Usage

To run the diabetes prediction pipeline:

1. **Clone the repository**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mettlrob/FoDS-Diabetes-Diagnosis.git
   cd FoDS-Diabetes-Diagnosis


2. **Set up the environment**
