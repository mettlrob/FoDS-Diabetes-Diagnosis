## About The Project

This project aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of diabetes onset.  
It is based on the [Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), a well-established benchmark in clinical machine learning tasks.

We implemented standardized preprocessing, SMOTE-based balancing, and multiple classification algorithms including KNN, SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression.  
Nested cross-validation was used to ensure robust model selection and performance evaluation.

> Glucose, BMI, and Age were consistently ranked as top predictors across all models.
