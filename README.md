## ðŸ“‹ Description

This project applies a complete machine learning pipeline to predict diabetes onset in female patients using the **Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset**. The goal is to develop a robust, interpretable, and generalizable predictive model by integrating:

- Zero-imputation of missing data  
- Standardized preprocessing  
- SMOTE for class balancing  
- Hyperparameter tuning  
- Nested cross-validation  
- ROC analysis
- SHAP

This work was completed as part of the final project for **FS25 Foundations of Data Science** at ETH Zurich.
